✅ 2. About Us 
OUR STORY
At Dizerodha LLP, we’re more than just a service provider—we’re a story of resilience, friendship, and purpose.
It all began in 2020, during one of the world’s toughest times. The pandemic had brought life to a halt. People were stuck indoors, unsure how to access even the most basic services. But over a simple plate of pakodas and an evening chat, two friend fresh out of the University —asked themselves a powerful question: “What if we could bring essential services to people, without them having to step outside?”
That was the spark. And from that moment, Cyber Cafe on a Call was born.
What started as a humble effort to help few customers grew into a mission to reach thousands. With dedication, accuracy, and genuine care, we built trust—by being there when it mattered most, guiding every form, every step, every time. We didn’t just process forms; we listened, guided, and stood beside every customer who needed support.
Today, after serving over 6,500+ customers, our dream has grown—and so have we. Seeing the impact, we knew it was time to go bigger. That’s when we registered Dizerodha LLP—a name that carries our promise forward across India.
Why do people choose us? Because we’re not just about documents and deadlines. We’re about making life easier. We know your time is precious. We know paperwork is a pain. So we handle the hassle, while you focus on what matters most.
We’re here, Beyond Barriers, Beside You—and this is just the beginning.
